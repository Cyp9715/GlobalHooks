    /*As per my research, it seems that a message loop (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2222365/what-is-a-message-pump) is needed by a low level hook for it to work properly.
     * Standard consoles do not implement this as compared to GUI applications (by using the Application.Run method). In order to fix the issue we are having with console apps, we need to subscribe to the message pump.
     * See the MessagePump.CS to see how this is implemented.*/
